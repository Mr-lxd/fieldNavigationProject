# Crop Row Navigation Line Extraction Project
## Project Introduction
This project is based on OpenCV 4.5.5 & Qt 4.4.1, and aims to extract navigation lines from crop rows in different growth stages and field environments. Navigation lines can be used to guide agricultural robots to perform diverse field management tasks at the seedling stage such as weeding, spraying pesticides and root-zone soil backfill, pose a crucial role in improving the crop yield and quality.
## Dataset
The dataset used for testing can be downloaded from [10.6084/m9.figshare.24188097](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/crops_at_different_growth_stages_and_environments/24188097). The dataset contains images of different crops (corn, sugarcane, rice), different growth stages and different field environments (such as paddy field, dryland, weed, etc.). Most of the images with a resolution of 4096x3072 pixels. 
## Installation and Running
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:
- OpenCV 4.5.5 or higher
- Qt 4.4.1 or higher
- Visual Studio 2019 or higher
